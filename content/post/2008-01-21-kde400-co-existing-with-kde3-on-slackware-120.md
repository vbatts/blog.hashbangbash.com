check it out, and tell me where it breaks. i can not be responsible for this breaking any kind of your install, but if if does, do tell ðŸ˜‰

this is very, very, to me. on my wife&#8217;s laptop, it boots to a kdm console, where you can choose your session like normal, and kde4 is an option now!! and kde3/qt3 never have to get uninstalled.
