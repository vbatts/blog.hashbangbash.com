for any who are interested,
  
**Totally** unofficial.
  
the SlackBuilds for kde-4.0.1 on Slackware-12.0 (and -current) are pretty well stabilized.
  
you can check it out with svn from <http://batts.mine.nu/pub/src/SlackBuilds/kde4/>
  
and its up to you to download the kde and deps source ðŸ˜‰
  
if it breaks, let me know, vbatts(AT)batts(DOT)mine(DOT)nu
