due to my current line of work, i am not able to completely migrate to the latest stable java, version 6, that ships with slackware-12.2 and slackware-current.
  
i have taken a snapshot of the last slackware build scripts, for java 1.5 and have kept them updated for the latest jre and jdk updates.
  
you can find them here for the [jdk][1] and the [jre][2]

currently it is on 1.5.0 update 17, but this is an svn directory, so it may bump versions at a later date.

enjoy,

vb
