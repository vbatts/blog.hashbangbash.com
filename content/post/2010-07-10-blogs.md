Much time spent today surrounding blogs of sorts. Adding new services for friends and customers. Upgrading to the latest [wordpress 3.0][1], and so forth.
  
I figured it may be a good time to bump this blog of my own. If for now other reason, but to express how nice, simple and easy a [LAMP stack][2] is on Linux.

After attempting to play support for a family member&#8217;s [OSX server][3]. The voodoo happening that is running many of the services, is beyond my interest of discoverying why and how Apple is venturing away from being a Unix. It seems they are going the way of Microsoft. Little signs like keeping files like /etc/resolv.conf present, but symlinked off somewhere else. Furthermore, it includes a warning the most processes of the operating system do not use it. How frustrating.

Give me a Linux host.

Take care,
