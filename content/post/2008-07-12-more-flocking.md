so after tinkering with the tar.gz downloaded from <http://www.flock.com/> , i figured i would make it managable, so i just finished working out a couple of build scripts for slackware-{12.1,-current}, you can find the script source on <a href="http://hashbangbash.com/pub/src/SlackBuilds/" target="_blank">http://hashbangbash.com/pub/src/SlackBuilds/</a> , but the finished slackpkgs are available on <http://cardinal.lizella.net/~vbatts/packages/>

as you might deduce, there are two versions, the flock-1.2.3 is their current stable, and the flock2-2.0b1 is their very recent beta 1 release, with the firefox3 backend. currently the flock2 is the version i&#8217;m using ðŸ˜‰

enjoy
