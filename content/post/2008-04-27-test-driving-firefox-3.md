so i figured i would give it a try, so far so good. it does &#8216;seem&#8217; much faster, and to have a smaller footprint, while i haven&#8217;t done any measurements, its likely to all be in my head.

i&#8217;m testing driving it on my slackware-current machine, and packaged it using volkerding scripts for the current firefox stable, in slackware-current/source/mozilla-firefox/.

then only relative script/diff changes were for the version change.
