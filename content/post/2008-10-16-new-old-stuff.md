I&#8217;ve found several old ideas that i had jotted down, from years past. figure as much to post them here periodically, maybe someone will enjoy stumbling upon them. so the first in these thoughts:

consciouness
  
2006.Aug.30

Who do you think you are?
  
your feeling of entitlement to your thoughts and ideas because you realize you exist.
  
the moment you breath and realize it.
  
you are burned and feel it, stop and think about it, what exactly are you feeling, and why does this vessel make you feel it like that.

yes, you are looking around you, and see and hear and smell.
