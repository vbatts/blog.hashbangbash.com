A simple candle-flame meditation:

> Light a candle in a darkened room. 
  
> Move about two feet away from it and sit down, facing the candle flame.
  
> Get comfortable.
  
> Then begin breathing in and out quietly through your nostrils.
  
> Let your body relax. Let your breath relax.
  
> Just concentrate on the candle flame.
  
> Watch it for several minutes.
  
> Don&#8217;t think about anything in particular. Let your thoughts go; let them settle.
  
> Watch the flame. Let your mind go into it.
  
> Suddenly blow out the candle and close your eyes.
  
> See the image that forms on the inside of your eyelids.
  
> Meditate on that light.
