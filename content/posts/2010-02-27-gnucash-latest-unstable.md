just a quick bump that i have uploaded my latest slackware builds of <a href="http://cardinal.lizella.net/~vbatts/downloads/gnucash/" target="_blank">gnucash to cardinal</a>

it will still all the dependencies. and now can use libdbi (for database storage), and webkit (for rendering reports). such as it is, i have compiled these in with these builds.

enjoy and take care,
