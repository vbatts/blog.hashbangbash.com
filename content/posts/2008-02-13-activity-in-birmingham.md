last in Birmingham, AL, was the [TechMixer Expo][1], downtown in the [McWane Science Center][2].
  

  
with 700+ Pre-registered attendees, and appearantly many more that just showed up, my suscipions are that the show had well over 1000+ attendees.
  
we were there with the [Bham-LUG][3] booth, for linux and FOSS. i had my laptop on display. i enabled the xgl / beryl grapics for added eye candy. other guys from the group brought their personal [OLPC XO laptop][4], we had probably 5 on display at any given time. we had 50+ live cd&#8217;s available, and only 3 left at the end of the night.

Good Times.
