while this isn&#8217;t much of a &#8220;blog&#8221; post, as it is just to say, that i&#8217;ve just finished compiling the pre-kde-4.1, kde-4.0.66 and qt-4.4.0-beta1 on slackware-12.0
  
it is still as sexy looking, but there have been a number of little tweaks, some subtle enough that i&#8217;m not even noticing them, except for that the desktop is smoother for everyday usage. BUT the primary fix i see, was my biggest errg with 4.0.0, and that is &#8216;panel settings&#8217;. that huge panel was no good, and i needed to change it, now i can ðŸ˜‰

if you want to compile it yourself, you can get the build scripts that i&#8217;ve hacked on <http://hashbangbash.com/pub/src/Slackbuilds/kde4/>
  
i got the QT source from Trolltech, at <http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/qt44-preview-download>
  
and the KDE source you can find at may different mirrors, i got mine from <http://mirror.facebook.com/kde/unstable/4.0.66/>
