i recently watched a lecture of [Randy Pausch][1], his [last lecture][2], and followed up by looking into the [Alice Project][3] that he was a major part of. after a bit of playing with it, i have put together packaging scripts for slackware for it, [Available here][4], and you can just download the slackpkg of it [here][5]. (notice alice is dependent on jre-1.5, which i have available for download as well)

cheers, and i&#8217;m glad there are great people out there in the world
