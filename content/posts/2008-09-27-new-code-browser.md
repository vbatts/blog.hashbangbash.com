as a few of you may have seen, a couple of svn repositories have been served up here on [http://hashbangbash.com/][1] for a while.
  
like 

  * [http://hashbangbash.com/pub/src/][2] 
  * [as a few of you may have seen, a couple of svn repositories have been served up here on [http://hashbangbash.com/][1] for a while.
  
like 

  * [http://hashbangbash.com/pub/src/][2] 
  *][3] for [Bham-LUG][4] 
  * [http://hashbangbash.com/pub/alf/ for alabama lug fest][5] 

most notably &#8216;/pub/src/&#8217; since its where the SlackBuilds and kde projects are kept.

WELL, there is now <http://hashbangbash.com/viewcvs/> to more easily browse and review these repos. it will default to /pub/src/, but the others can be chosen from the menu if the upper right side.

cheers
