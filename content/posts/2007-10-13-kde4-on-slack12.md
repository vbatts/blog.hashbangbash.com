i&#8217;ve just taken it on as a goal and project to get a working compile of the KDE4 trunk since it&#8217;s release is coming up on the 18th and it hasn&#8217;t been branched out yet. and what better than to try it on a slackware install that i&#8217;m not use to.
  
so far there have been a few things interesting about it, since i can&#8217;t just install some \*-devel or \*-dev packages to satisfy the header dependencies needed. But good thing is that slack is still a very from source distro, prepared for compiling, so many of the needed libraries and headers are already there.
  
primarily i&#8217;m building it on a slack box for a couple of different reasons.
    
1) i don&#8217;t want to mess with my personal or work laptop and there environments.
    
2) i have a system installed and running a standard Slackware 12.0 install, that isn&#8217;t being used for anything right now.
    
3) they didn&#8217;t have the howto&#8217;s reference on the kde4 build tutorial, that calls to a challenge in me
    
4) i feel that, if i get it done in a timely manner, providing my howto and documentation could contribute back to the community.

i will add more blog posts here, and any needed files will go to http://hashbangbash.com/downloads/kde4/
