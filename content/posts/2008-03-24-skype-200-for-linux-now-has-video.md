YAAH!

i was in class and opening skype to see if i could find someone in Japan to talk to, and i figured i would see if there is a newer version of skype available, indeed there was.

but the jump from 1.4.0 -> 2.0.0, is the addition of video to linux, this is great, really great. now i have to dig out my webcam so i can get it working. ðŸ˜‰
