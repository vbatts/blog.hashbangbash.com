I&#8217;m pretty well taking forever to complete my college degree, but this go round has good rhythm. and at this pass, it should bea good means to an end. the material can be or is interesting, and to an extent I am enjoying it. 

the Intermediate Accounting course, with Dr. Nell Adkins, is quite enjoyable. While
  
I initially quietly disputed that she doesn&#8217;t allow computers or really anything except for a pen and paper, but i&#8217;ve come to enjoy it, as a new refreshment. So far it has been just the hardcore numbers, and it makes sense, more sense than the AC201 course that i had taken with Edmonds.

the AC304 course, Accounting Information Systems, i guess this course is a &#8216;needed&#8217; course. But really, this course could use some major revamping. or at least the instructor seems like he needs to be let out of his box, so he can broaden his awareness and refresh his concepts. Namely, because half of this course is to be instructed on the use of Microsoft Great Plains Dynamics accounting software, i have as much problems as i did with the early Information Systems course i was **required** to take, that was nothing more than the usage of Microsoft Office. This is corporate propoganda, these instructors teach as if there is nothing else out there.
  
Even tonight, Dr. Tsai, tried to use an equation, that I see is quite false.
  
_(Price of software package) = ( total cost of labor) / ( potential volume of sales)_
  
using Microsoft Windows Vista as the example, saying that **every** new computer will come with an OEM version of Vista, and therefore you will pay _&#8220;almost nothing&#8221;_ for this highly developed piece of software. At which point i had to interject, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t _almost nothing_, it is over $100&#8243;. With the OEM arguement, Windows could be sold for $10 a license and Microsoft would still make a profit, but at $100-$200+ is why more millionaires have come from Microsoft&#8217;s employement base than any other company, and Bill Gates has been in the top 2 for wealth for ten years strong.
  
**_ergg_** i wish someone who professes this material spoke like they haven&#8217;t been fed, with benefits, by some large corporation.

anyhow,
  
more later
