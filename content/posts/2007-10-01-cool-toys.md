So this blog is coming to you from a [Nokia n770 internet tablet][1]. l&#8217;m test driving it to see if it&#8217;s something l would spend my money on. The keyboard takes a little getting used to, but l can look past that. So far l reflashed it with the 2OO7 hacker edition so it has the feel of the new N8OO model. Nokia has used the Debian package manager, and there&#8217;s plenty of good repositories for open source apps, and they&#8217;ve made the GUl package tool easy to add repos add/remove apps. Because of this, l&#8217;ve now got vnc, terminal, ssh, this wordpress blogging app and a significant textpad. But i&#8217;ve got to run now, i&#8217;ll post more later.
