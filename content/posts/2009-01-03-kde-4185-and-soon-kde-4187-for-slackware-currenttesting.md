hosted on <http://cardinal.lizella.net/~vbatts/> i&#8217;ve put the latest build of kde-4.1.85 for slackware (if you on -current, have un-installed kde-3.5.10 and have installed kde4 from /testing).

just download the deps and the 4.1.85 directory, then

> upgradepkg &#8211;install-new \*/\*.tgz

i had done this version a little bit ago and had forgotten to blog it, i also realize that 4.1.87 came out on Jan 01, i will publish it shortly.
